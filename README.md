## Overview
A Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) is a fundamental path planning algorithm in robotics, first developed by Steven LaValle in 1998.
Path planning is the task of moving a robot from one location to another, while avoiding obstacles and satisfying constraints.

### Task 1: Simple RRT
Simple RRT implementation in a two-dimensional domain, *D=[0,100]X[0,100]*


### Task 2: Planning a Path with Obstacles
RRT implementation in a two-dimensional domain, *D=[0,100]X[0,100]*, with circular obstacles.


## Usage and Configuration Instructions
To generate the RRT implementation, run the code `random_tree.py`.
- The number of obstacles can be changed from within the code.
