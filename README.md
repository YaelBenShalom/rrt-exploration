## Overview

A Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) is a fundamental path planning algorithm in robotics, first developed by Steven LaValle in 1998.
Path planning is the task of moving a robot from one location to another, while avoiding obstacles and satisfying constraints.

### Task 1: Simple RRT

Simple RRT implementation in a two-dimensional domain, _D=[0,100]X[0,100]_

### Task 2: Planning a Path with Obstacles

RRT implementation in a two-dimensional domain, _D=[0,100]X[0,100]_, with circular obstacles.

## Usage and Configuration Instructions

To generate the RRT implementation, run the code `random_tree.py`.

- The number of obstacles can be changed from within the code.
